<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2> 
<hr />

<h3>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</h3>
<p>Really long western that shows you don't need dialogue for a drawn-out but epic finish.</p>

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
<p>Solid feel good film that introduced me to the world of drama.</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The type of movie that forces you to think at the end.</p>
