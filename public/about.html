<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>

<p>Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two-tired!
  Why did the stadium get hot after the game? All of the fans left! Why do African Elephants have big ears? Because Noddy won't pay the ransom. 
  I recently won a pumpkin carving competition. It was a hollow victory. Which US state has the quietest laugh? Hawaii has a low ha. 
  Why do Swedish Battleships have barcodes on their boats? Because when they leave, they can scan the navy out. And when they return they can Scandinavian. 
  What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear! I was surprised when I broke the world record for catching the world’s biggest fish yesterday, 
  I'm still reeling. </p>

<p>Lost my job at Blackpool Pleasure Beach for no good reason I am suing them for funfair dismissal. 
  I was asked to name a Scandanavian country without the letter R in it I said "No Way!"
  What do you call a deer with no eyes? No idea. Did you hear about the man who drowned in his muesli? He was pulled under by a strong currant. 
  Why is there no pain killers in the jungle? Because the Parrots eat 'em all. Why don’t skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts! </p>
  
<p>Why don’t oysters donate to charity? Because they are shellfish! 
  I just quit my job to pursue a dream career in archeology. My career's in ruins. 
  Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged! Why did the blind boy fall down the well? He couldn't see that well.</p>
